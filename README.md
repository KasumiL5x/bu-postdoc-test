# Heart Failure Clinical Records
> A BU postdoc programming test.

This is a programming test for a BU postdoc position. It uses machine learning to predict death from heart failure based on a number of features. It comes with a Flask RESTful API written in Python, and a simple frontend that uses the API to display predictions.

Tech stack with Python `3.7.4`:

* `jupyter` for the notebooks.
* `numpy` for all things mathematical.
* `pandas` for dataframes and data processing.
* `matplotlib` for plotting graphs.
* `seaborn` for better graphs!
* `imblearn` for SMOTE resampling.
* `scipy` for stats.
* `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms and data processing.
* `joblib` for saving and loading trained models/pipelines/search spaces.
* `Flask` for creating and serving a RESTful API and frontend.

The rest of this README will come... eventually.
