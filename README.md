# Heart Failure Clinical Records
> A BU postdoc programming test.

This is a programming test for a BU postdoc position. It uses machine learning to predict death from heart failure based on a number of features. It comes with a Flask RESTful API written in Python, and a simple frontend that uses the API to display predictions.

Tech stack:

* Python
* sklearn and co.
* Flask (RESTful API and frontend)

The rest of this README will come... eventually.
