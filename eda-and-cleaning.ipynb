    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from the [UCL Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records#).  It contains medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure and consists of 13 clinical features.  There is also an [academic paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5) associated with this data, which is in fact based upon an [older paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181001).  Both of these papers provide significant detail about what the clinical features mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the challenge is to predict the `DEATH_EVENT` of a patient as a boolean (in the form of `0` or `1`).  The complete features present in the data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `age` — Age of the patient (years).\n",
    "* `anaemia` — Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean).\n",
    "* `high_blood_pressure` — If the patient has hypertension (boolean).\n",
    "* `creatinine_phosphokinase` — Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L).\n",
    "* `diabetes` — If the patient has diabetes (boolean).\n",
    "* `ejection_fraction` — Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage/100).\n",
    "* `platelets` — Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL).\n",
    "* `sex` — Woman or man (binary).\n",
    "* `serum_creatinine` — Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL).\n",
    "* `serum_sodium` — Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L).\n",
    "* `smoking` — If the patient smokes or not (boolean).\n",
    "* `time` — Follow-up period (days).\n",
    "* `DEATH_EVENT` — If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean).\n",
    "\n",
    "The newer paper that this data is based upon suggests that using only `ejection_fraction` and `serum_creatinine` can result in an accuracy of ~0.838 (among other measurements)."
